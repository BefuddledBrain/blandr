Package: blandr
Title: Blandr: a Bland-Altman Method Comparison Function for r
Version: 0.4.1
Description: Carries out Bland Altman analyses (also known as a 
    Tukey mean-difference plot). This package was created in 2015 as existing 
    Bland-Altman analysis functions did not calculate confidence intervals.
    This package was created to rectify this, and create reproducible plots.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
