## Preamble

This is an autogenerated report from the blandr R library. This report relies on the data being supplied to be accurate. Whilst it tries to provide some information on the data provided, it *IS NOT* a replacement for proper review (and sense checks) of the data. It is also *NOT* a replacement for formal statistical advice.  

The *blandr report automated tool* is intended to be a tool for the start of exploration of the data generated. Statistical agreement (or lack of) does not mean that there is no clinical (or "practical") agreement: what level of acceptable agreement should be defined before this tool is used. All use of the statistics provided is at the user's own risk.

## Interpreting the output

The two methods used in the comparison will be labelled "Method 1" and "Method 2". It is up to the user to understand which data they have supplied as these methods.

Questions to think about when interepreting the data include:

1. Should the two methods be compared?
2. Is the data correct?
3. *A priori*, what can be thought of as acceptable practical agreement?
4. In the data is there statistical agreement? (For all intents and purposed this will not be true)
5. In the data is there practical agreement?
6. What conclusions can be drawn from the data?

A suggestion by Chhapola et al. on reporting the data includes:

1. correct representation of x-axis on B-A plot
2. representation and correct definition of limits of agreement (LOA)
3. reporting of confidence interval (CI) of LOA
4. comparison of LOA with a priori defined clinical criteria
5. evaluation of the pattern of the relationship between difference (y-axis) and average (x-axis)
6. measures of repeatability.

## Description of the plots

The dashed lines represent the summary Bland-Altman statistical data, namely: (1) bias, (2) upper limit of agreement, (3) lower limit of agreement. The dotted line (when present) represent confidence intervals for the summary statistics.
